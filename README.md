# Sorting-Hat

The goal of this project was to predict a character's Hogwarts class given their full name using a classical machine learning model. The data used for training the model is the raw text of the 7 Harry Potter books. The notebook file contains the preprocessing and text-cleaning tasks performed on the data, in addition to extracting appropriate training samples for the model.

The data for the books can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammaindola/harry-potter-books/data). A custom test file is provided for evaluation.
